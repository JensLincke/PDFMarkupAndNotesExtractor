PDFMarkupAndNotesExtractor
==========================

shell script, that extracts the markup and notes of PDFs using, Apple's "Preview" Application and AppleScript

This script uses "Preview" to extract the annotations and notes of pdf files into a text file
Since there is no public API for extracting the annotations, it scraps them from the UI of "Preview"

NOTE: you will be asked to grand the "Terminal" the right to control your computer 
       and you have to allow this in your systems settings

WARNING: For this reason, the script might have to be adapted in future versions of "Preview"
